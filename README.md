# Welcome to Learning Patterns

These patterns are based on the concept of a _Pattern Language_ and provide a way to structure and create learning activities. 

The patterns here are the modular expression of the main Activity Types that university courses are usually based on:

1. Content
2. External Resources
3. Discussions
4. Practice
5. Assessment
6. Review and
7. Interaction

The Learning Patterns are an attempt to create a language for learning with a common vocabulary that align back to Laurillard's (2002) set of 'learning types' outlined in their Conversational Framework. The learning types align to an array of 'learning activities', common elements of a course where students spend their time. Based on these activities, we then derived a set of 'learning patterns' (Goodyear, 2005). These patterns provide the building blocks for bespoke learning experiences instead of templates that seek to maintain a strict structure. This approach focuses on a 'pattern language' (Alexander, 1977) rather than structural patterns. This differentiation, in effect, creates a tool to design with rather than for. The patterns provide us with the Lego pieces to build a tailored experiences with the benefit of providing scaffolding for the course author.
