Creating connections is one of the keys to students learning and aids the development of their schema. For many students moving along the novice/expert continuum, these connections are missing, so providing them with explicit and direct information about how things relate to one another can provide a shortcut for the learner and helps them to assimilate new information. Try and be accurate and concise when you develop your connection. Be clear as to what relates, how it relates and why it relates. It is also essential to be clear to students why this relationship matters. In some instances, it may be helpful to illustrate this relationship and create or develop a graphic to convey how the connection works.",

Next should come the supporting information that gives a sequenced explanation of how and why something works or happens. If it&#39;s required, a concluding sentence should give a brief summary of the process. When it comes to making an idea easy to understand, simple trumps clever and complicated. Make your students feel smart by building their knowledge and confidence and dazzle them with clarity. Add details sparingly—come back to one or two big ideas you know they will understand.

Illustrations are able to explain complex ideas in a simple and more accessible format by encoding information through colour, shapes and rhythm rather than just relying on text and words. This often requires some creativity and understanding of the concept in order to accurately encode that information using visual devices, but this can be achieved through collaboration with designers and media experts. An illustration should aim to depict the concept, not necessarily interpret it, and can often help to reduce supporting information to a minimum. Rather than make the illustration do everything, use it with patterns like explanations. You can also use multiple illustrations to go through a stepped process, where the image evolves with extra detail as you go through each part of the explanation. Do this on a timeline, and you have an animation. ",

Quotes help construct a context for students and can be invaluable in explaining how ideas and practices have evolved. They can also help provide students with concise explanations in the original author&#39;s words. Remember that quotes can be more than just published text.

Learners should ensure their notes can stand alone and make sense without the original resource. This means taking notes using their own words and in their voice. The review stage requires the learner to utilise their notes and interpret them to create a summary, connection, or explanation. An alternative way to structure the task is to separate the act of note-taking by creating a shared note and then creating individual reviews. Another way could be asking students to swap notes and then create a review from another student&#39;s notes. Sharing the work across the class can be helpful when breadth is required, and you are seeking to expose students to a variety of external resources, and there are too many for a single student.",

Instead of just consuming a resource, the aim is to create an activity that helps the learner contextualise the resource more broadly. Typically, learners are told to consider the topic as they work through an external resource that has been chosen specifically to relate to the current topic. The aim here, however, is to ask learners to create that relationship, which means the resource should be a little left-field. Rather than being directly related or from the established literature, the resource may be an example of theory in practice, a concept&#39;s execution, or a recent news article. Learners will have to work to relate the resource to the topic at hand. Ideally, this activity would be followed by an Interactive activity.

So the ability to Apply a Model to different circumstances is valuable for students to practice. An excellent way to go about this is to set up scenarios where this can occur. In these scenarios, it is essential to ensure alignment between previous examples the students have seen with this new scenario. If important values, terms or components of the model need to be identified correctly, then they should have their equivalents in the new scenario for students to match these up.

They are helpful for complex situations where solutions are uncertain and require multiple perspectives. They are perfect launch pads for further class discussion or as a project for individuals or small groups. Case studies allow students to practice inductive and deductive reasoning depending on the location within their course. Inductive reasoning requires the student to understand what is going on from the case study and then have it confirmed and explained in the following content.

By working through the process, students should be able to self-correct in a way that the next steps would provide feedback or information to let the student know they have made a mistake. For example, if they solve a mathematical equation and put that into another formula, they should be able to tell (or be provided with direct feedback) that the value they have entered is incorrect.

The loop aims to evaluate the student&#39;s ability to make the required changes more than their proficiency at the task. The loop could be part of formative or summative assessments, where the initial submission is treated as a draft and not marked, whereas the final version is, with a significant component of the marks being on how well the student has implemented the requested changes. One way to do this is for students to submit their work, giving feedback using track changes and comments. The student then actions the feedback, and the document is resubmitted. Track changes should be on so the marker can see how the work has progressed and how the student has addressed the comments and markup in the document. ",

This process ensures that learners are correct and demonstrate their competency at each stage so as not to fail at the larger task. This strategy is essential when a mistake at a single point will mean failure overall. Identifying these failure points is crucial for these tasks, and each one needs to be accompanied by feedback that allows the learner to self-correct. Feedback must ensure that the learner understands at which point they failed and why. This kind of task may require students to submit multiple times or to remedy their process before the next task through discussion with the teacher.",

For genuine formative learning, the debrief is the focus as it enables the observer and participant to reflect on the task and how their participation can be corrected or improved. The debrief can be used to discuss what went wrong and what went right, allowing learners to reflect on their own practice. A good debrief isn&#39;t just about observing the scenario itself but linking the thought processes, emotions and experience to the learning journey. A debrief is a facilitated process where discussion is developed and steered to meet the objective of providing students with the chance to practice and reflect on and develop their skills and experience from that practice.",

If these skills align with the course learning outcomes or program learning outcomes, students must be provided with opportunities to practice. Development of skills requires two things: repetition and feedback. Repetition requires students to be provided with multiple chances to complete similar tasks. Deploying their skills several times assists in the development of understanding and schema. Feedback at each attempt is also important as students need to be able to evaluate themselves and diagnose problem areas and mistakes. Combining repetition and feedback means learners should have evidence of their improvement over time as they get more fluent and experienced.",

In a Try Again situation, the student continues to submit until they are 100% correct. This practice tests their competency and understanding before moving on and helps build a solid foundation and connection for their knowledge and skills to grow. This step is crucial in foundation topics, where an understanding is a requirement for progression. Adopting this technique can drastically improve a learner&#39;s success, but you must accompany it with generous and patient feedback.

You may want to start by asking the creators to provide contextual information to the reviewers, such as their intent, who their audience was, and what constraints and choices they made. It is also worthwhile setting goals and intentions for the reviewers too - what are they expected to comment on, what is out of bounds, and what they can provide suggestions or instructions. Some of the most valuable critiques are necessarily the judgements, but questions back to the student about their work. Get reviewers to focus feedback on addressing the intent and goals of the work and how effective they were in addressing them.",

Using structured feedback, like a rubric, students can learn to evaluate the quality of their peers and their work. This kind of task works well for encouraging peer interaction and social learning and provides a scalable method of review and feedback that doesn&#39;t put the onus on the teaching staff. Pushing this work onto students requires students to be provided with support, clear instructions and clarity around the method of review, what they should be looking for and tone of communication. If it is left too open, there is the potential for students to misinterpret, misunderstand and compound that with incorrect feedback on their work.",

Students should use them to evaluate their ability to recall and interpret information or solve specific problems. The questions themselves can be complicated and nuanced. For an effective review, a quiz needs to provide feedback to the learners so they can identify their mistakes and correctly answer moving forward. Feedback and answers should be developed at the same time as the questions. For example, if creating multiple choice questions, don&#39;t just choose random answers and one correct. Choose them in a way that helps to identify common mistakes and misunderstandings - for example, flipping the numerator and denominator in an equation. It will ensure the review process improves the students learning, rather than simply testing their knowledge. ",

Space Repetition requires tasks to be spaced out and occur across the teaching period. Rather than a one-off, students learn from the routine and regular opportunity to apply knowledge and skills. Each task can use the same knowledge or skills and apply them to different situations, but they must include repeated elements. Including feedback in the task helps students improve their ability and skill and, over time, improves their performance.",

This type of review provides students with a sense of responsibility and accomplishment to personalise their learning journey throughout the course.

        scaffold: "Feedback is vital to personal development, and each individual can benefit from it when done correctly. It is essential to understand that feedback, by its nature, is a cyclical process rather than linear. This means that feedback shouldn&#39;t be the end point of a task and instead occur before the last step so it can be actioned and implemented. One common problem with assessments is that the learner focuses on the marks rather than the journey they go through and the evolution of their work. We often consciously make feedback disposable in that sense and secondary to the marks attached because there is no follow-through. At the course design stage, it is essential to consider how formative and summative assessments can work together and how a review task like task feedback can feed into a subsequent assessment where marks are attached. Consider pairing review tasks, like task feedback, with productive assessments so that marks are given to actioning feedback and improving the work done by students.",

A test environment should allow students to make all the possible mistakes in this safe environment and learn from the consequences. This learning experience is common in some fields, like developing code, but can be applied more broadly to other disciplines. From administering doses of pharmaceuticals to identifying problems in accounting documents to working with problematic data sets. Test environments develop an understanding of the consequences of their actions and decisions and provide a way to experience the consequences and confront them through their mistakes. Getting something wrong is necessary for learning, but it can also be demoralising. It&#39;s vital to enable students to uncover their mistakes, learn where they went wrong and try again.",

        scaffold: "This kind of interaction is about trying to involve the class as a whole and is perfect for when you want to explore diversity and individual experiences within the class. It is essential to note that the conversation needs to be facilitated well for the group to feel able to contribute. A facilitator often needs to encourage and invite class members to speak for students to feel comfortable sharing. This may require the facilitator to take the lead and share their thoughts or experiences before inviting others. The facilitator needs to ensure that the class is a safe space to share and may need to lay some ground rules about the topic, fence off certain aspects and at times interrupt the conversation to guide it back on topic. The active facilitator role is essential when introducing this kind of activity, but over time, it can become more learned and practised by the students and requires less input as the course progresses.",

This could include developing a shared reading list, assembling a glossary, contributing to a data set, or discussing key issues – which then aids each student complete their own task. This shared work reduces the load on the individual, and a single contribution can have a much more significant impact when collected from the whole class. Cooperative tasks also reduce the risks and problems usually associated with group assessments by decoupling the group&#39;s efforts from the individual&#39;s mark.",

This social interaction allows students to see different perspectives and can often unlock unique and creative solutions that students may not have been able to develop independently. Affinity mapping is a common technique for this task where individuals independently write out their ideas (often on sticky notes) which are then shared with the class, who then systematically group notes that are similar or share common elements. These grouping can then be presented as a Venn diagram, flowchart, hierarchy, or some other visual or written form that captures the main ideas and their relationships.",

Drop-in and student-led sessions can augment timetabled interactive sessions and provide an additional point for students to connect or seek support from teaching staff. These sessions should coincide with scheduled points in the course, like assessment submission dates, to help clarify details and answer questions. They may also be prompted by discussion forums or questions during scheduled teaching sessions. They can also be added to a course plan to coincide with challenging topics or known problematic areas within the course.",

The aim of sharing isn&#39;t to convince students of another opinion or to reach a consensus but to demonstrate to students that there is breadth and variation in the chosen topic or concept. This activity is best suited to points in the course when drawing on the diversity within the class is beneficial.

All students tend to have an opinion, so creating space for them in the course is a great way to get direct insight into their learning. It can be helpful in a before and after context to chart students&#39; change in knowledge and understanding of a topic. It is also a simple way to relate contemporary issues to the topic. It can be helpful as a diagnostic to correct misunderstandings and misinterpretations or to fill in gaps that students may have missed. If these opinions are available to be viewed by other students, they can be a resource that allows reflection on their own opinion and see what diversity is in the class.",

A personal experience has a lot of resonance with individuals. It can make learning more tangible and real for many who find engaging with textbooks and imagined scenarios challenging. Experiences are, by their nature, personal and can be linked to quite intimate or emotional moments. It is important to acknowledge this might be the case in the activity instructions, as some students may not feel comfortable sharing their experiences, especially if they are negative. Respect your learners and their privacy and always invite them to share, which many will do without issue, rather than make it a mandatory requirement. ",

Some good examples of tasks that would be suitable would include; working through a problem, example or case study; contributing to a document or shared response; or creating a list of resources, papers and literature. These kinds of tasks can work as asynchronous and synchronous tasks and are helpful for low-stakes work and getting students used to learning in a social context. These tasks must be scaffolded and provide learners with clear instructions and roles, especially when introduced to students. If these tasks are used consistently throughout a course or program, you can reduce these explicit instructions as learners become used to this way of working and self-organise. It is important to note that regardless of the level of study, you should treat each group of students as novices when it comes to this kind of task. Knowledge and experiences of teamwork apply to specific groups, and what works in one group may not transfer to another.",

This activity groups learners together for the specific purpose of speaking more deeply with each other about the topic. The aim is for students to share knowledge and experiences to cooperate and build their understanding of a topic. You will need to provide questions that encourage students to share their thoughts and experiences.
