	<p>The aim of an explanation is to describe how something works or is done. The structure of an explanation should start with the topic that identifies what is being explained. Next should come the supporting information that gives a sequenced explanation of how and why something works or happens. If it's required, a concluding sentence should give a brief summary of the process. When it comes to making an idea easy to understand, simple trumps clever and complicated. Make your students feel smart by building their knowledge and confidence and dazzle them with clarity. Add details sparingly—come back to one or two big ideas you know they will understand. Use an explanation to help and support the student embed the concept and relate it to their understanding.</p>
