	<p>The aim of this activity is for learners to share a tangible example from their world view and experience. This can be useful for teaching to work out how well learners understand the topic, if they can apply it to different circumstances, and how it might relate across different discipline areas. For courses that have students enrolled from a variety of professions and disciplines this can be incredibly useful as learners are exposed to circumstances they are unfamiliar with or possibilities they would not have thought of on their own.</p>
