	<p>Discussion</p>
<p>Inquiry</p>
<p>Conceptual Changes</p>
<p>This discussion gets students forming their own ideas about a topic based on the content they’ve read. Once they’ve formed their own ideas, they must then question their own methods and challenge their original thoughts. These are great ways to get students thinking critically about their own ideas, coaching them to reflect and self-evaluate.</p>
