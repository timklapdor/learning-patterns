	<p>This is a guided approach to problem solving. Each step will have the student evaluate the problem and receive prompts to think of ways to fix/deal with the problem. This kind of discussion may need to happen in phases and be broken up throughout a module. First students work through the information to make an assessment. They then work through diagnostic information before being asked to develop a solution. As a group activity, there may be many variations or opinions that need to be corrected. If this occurs, you may need to steer students by providing them with an explanation.</p>
