	<p>The aim of relating an external resource is to help the learner contextualise a resource to the content of the topic being studied. Typically, the learner would be asked to consider the topic being studied as they read the external resource, and would have an opportunity to communicate to the Instructor and/or their peers their understanding of the relevance of the resource to the topic.</p>
