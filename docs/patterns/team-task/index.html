	<p>A team task requires learners to work together, build consensus and provide a shared body of work. This could include working through an problem, example or case study together; contributing to a document or shared response; or creating a list of resources, papers and literature. These kinds of tasks can work as assynchronous and synchronous task and are useful for low stakes work and getting students used to learning in a social context. These tasks may need to be scaffolded and provide learners with clear instructions and roles to begin with, but these explicit constraints can be reduced as time goes on and learners become used to this way of working and self organising. It is important to note that regardless of the level of study you should treat each group of students as novices in this space, as knowledge and experience of team work is often linked to a specific group of people and what works in one group may not transfer to another.</p>
