	<p>The aim of a definition is to guarantee the meaning of a term is consistent for all learners. It also helps to negate other meanings or uses of the terms learners bring from other contexts or assumed knowledge. These are vital for when you first introduce a term so that clarity is provided upfront. Consider how you might reinforce this definition throughout the course, reiterating and referencing it.</p>
