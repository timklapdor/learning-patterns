	<p>Dividing the class into small groups allows more space and time for more active participation in the conversation. This activity groups learners together as a team for the specific purpose of having a conversation and to talk more deeply with each other about a topic. The aim is for students to share knowledge and experience in order to cooperate and build their understanding a topic. You will need to provide a set of questions that encourages students to share their own thoughts and experiences rather than providing specific answers and you may wish to supplement these with prompts for follow-up questions so that learners have the tools to facilitate their own deeper team conversation.</p>
