	<p>The aim of annotation of an external resource is to enable critique of the resource itself, or what the resource contains. The focus of the critique would depend on the context within which the task is occurring. For example, learners may be asked to critique an argument or theory being discussed in a resource, as a way of demonstrating their engagement with theoretical concepts. Alternatively, learners may be asked to critique the way in which a resource has been structured and presented, as a way of demonstrating their engagement with text and language composition.</p>
