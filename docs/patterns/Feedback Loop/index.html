<p>Feedback Loop</p>
<p>A feedback loop provides learners with an opportunity of practice, getting feedback, and then applying that feedback to modify their original submission. The aim of this loop is to evaluate the student's ability to make the required changes more than their proficiency at the task. One way this could be done is that students submit their work, the feedback is provided using track changes and comments, this is then acted upon and this version is resubmitted. Track changes should be left on, so that the marker can see how the work progresses and how the student has addressed the comments and markup contained in the document. The loop itself could be part of formative and summative assessments, where the initial submission is treated as a draft and not marked, whereas the final version is, with a major component of the marks being on how well the student has implemented the requested changes.</p>
