	<p>Discussion</p>
<p>Inquiry</p>
<p>Consensus Building</p>
<p>This kind of discussion is tricky and requires students to understand a process for reaching consensus. You should outline this for students as there are distinct phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduce and Clarify - students seek to understand the problem at hand and ask questions around the definitions and parameters of the problem.</li>
<li>Explore Ideas - open the discussion as an exploration to seek common and shared understanding.</li>
<li>Form a Proposal - as a group work towards a position and statement from the group. This doesn't have to be perfect, but a start.</li>
<li>Test the Proposal - test the position out and see how it performs for the group. Does it address the problem?</li>
<li>Amend the Proposal - iterate between testing and amending the statement until there is no more agreed movement.</li>
<li>Submit the Proposal - circulate the final statement from the group.</li>
</ol>
