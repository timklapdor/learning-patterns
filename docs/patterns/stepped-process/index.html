	<p>The aim of a stepped process is to make explicit every action the learner needs to take, and what the result should be once they've performed each step in the process. A stepped process is a form of instruction but is best presented as numbered steps. Each step is not just listed, but also explained in terms of addressing how or why the step is important.</p>
