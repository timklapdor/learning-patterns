		<h1>interpretive &amp; evaluative</h1>
		<p class="definition">This kind of discussion starts by asking questions about the intentions or goals of the author, creator, character etc. Then students are asked to evaluate the veracity of these intentions, and finally the effectiveness of the methods used.</p>

	<main class="discussion">

	<p>This kind of discussion works well in conjunction with an external resource or case study where students are asked to initially interpret and perceive the intended outcomes or purpose. After they work through the information, they are then asked to evaluate how effective and how close to those initial intentions they were.</p>
