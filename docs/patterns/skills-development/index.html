	<p>The learning journey isn’t only about knowledge: often it requires the acquisition and development of specific skills. If these skills align to the course learning outcomes or program learning outcomes, it is vital for learners to be given opportunities to practice. Development of skills requires two things: repetition and feedback. Repetition requires for students to be provided with multiple chances to complete similar tasks a number of times to assist in development of understanding and schema. Feedback at each attempt is also important after each attempt. Students need to be able to evaluate themselves and diagnose problem areas and mistakes. Combining repetition and feedback means learners should have evidence of their improvement over time as they get more fluent and experienced.</p>
