	<p>Open questions should allow every student to participate and contribute to a discussion because there is no singular, wrong or right answer. Instead an open ended question should provide a hook to what the student already knows, or allows them to connect new information to a circumstance they are familiar with. Good open ended questions tend to be grammatically closed but cognitively open, meaning they provide a narrow or simple framing but allow the student to open up and invite elaboration and enquiry. An initial yes/no answer to a question can be 'opened up' by the a follow up question like 'why do you think that?,' 'Could there be an instance where that's not the case?'.</p>
