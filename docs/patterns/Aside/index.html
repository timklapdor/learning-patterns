	<p>Asides are useful in providing contextual information. They are a common feature in magazine, newspaper features and textbooks where they can provide readers with additional information that is related to what is being covered, but doesn't necessarily fit with the narrative structure. Students can benefit from asides by using them to provide information at the point in need and using them for supporting and contextual information. Asides are often used to provide summaries and lists of information, key fact statements, statistics and timelines alongside the content so that students don't have to move away or navigate to another page or source of information.</p>
