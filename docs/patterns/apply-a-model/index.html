	<p>A good deal of learning comes through the application of knowledge to other areas. This isn't necessarily an intuitive process and often requires adaption in order to work. So the ability to Apply a Model to different circumstances is valuable for students to practice. A good way to go about this is set up scenarios where this can occur. In these scenarios it is important to ensure that there is alignment between the existing model and previous examples students have seen to this new scenario. If there are important values, terms or components of the model that need to be identified correctly, then they should have their equivalent in the new scenario and students should be able to match these up. If there is an uneven number or missing information it will make it far more difficult for the student connect the existing model to the new.</p>
