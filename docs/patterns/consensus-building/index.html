		<h1>consensus building</h1>
		<p class="definition">The aim of this discussion is to agree on a single answer. For this to occur, students must work together and work out what it is they can agree on. This doesn&#39;t mean getting the correct answer, but one that has agreement from the group. This kind of discussion should focus on compromise and identifying similarities and differences. </p>

	<main class="discussion">

	<p>This kind of discussion is tricky and requires students to understand a process for reaching consensus. You should outline this for students as there are distinct phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduce and Clarify - students seek to understand the problem at hand and ask questions around the definitions and parameters of the problem.</li>
<li>Explore Ideas - open the discussion as an exploration to seek common and shared understanding.</li>
<li>Form a Proposal - as a group work towards a position and statement from the group. This doesn't have to be perfect, but a start.</li>
<li>Test the Proposal - test the position out and see how it performs for the group. Does it address the problem?</li>
<li>Amend the Proposal - iterate between testing and amending the statement until there is no more agreed movement.</li>
<li>Submit the Proposal - circulate the final statement from the group.</li>
</ol>
