	<p>A loop back is a narrative device that helps student learning by recalling topics, ideas and information that have previously been mentioned. A loop back engages students by engaging their recall ability and helps to develop connections in their schema. The original idea can act as an anchor or foundation from which to expand and branch from. When using this pattern, provide a link back to the original idea and where it is in the course, include a brief summary of it, and then explain why you are asking the student to reconsider it.</p>
