	<p>The aim of this activity is to draw on learners' personal experience to provide examples and for other learners to see how these various experiences relate to the topic. A personal experience has a lot of resonance with individuals and can make the learning more tangible and real for many who find it difficult to engage with textbooks and imagined scenarios. Experiences are, by their nature, personal and may be linked to quite personal or emotional moments. It is, therefore, important to acknowledge this might be the case in the activity instructions as some students may not feel comfortable sharing their experiences, especially if they are negative or linked to broader traumatic experiences. This applies even to the most seemingly mundane tasks in life. Respect your learners and their privacy and always invite them to share, which many will do without issue, rather than make it a mandatory requirement.</p>
