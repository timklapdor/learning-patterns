	<p>The aim of summarising an external resource is to provide students with an opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of the content of a resource. Being able to identify and connect concepts discussed in a resource, and use skills like paraphrasing to explain them to others, requires students to be able to explore a resource in depth.</p>
