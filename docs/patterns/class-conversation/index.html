	<p>This kind of interaction is about trying to involve the class as a whole and is perfect for when you want to explore diversity and individual experience within the class. In this kind of environment though it is important to note that the conversation needs to be facilitated well in order for the group to feel able to contribute. A facilitator often needs to encourage and invites class members to speak in order for students to feel comfortable sharing. This may require the facilitator to take the lead and share their thoughts or experiences before inviting others. The facilitator needs to ensure that the class is a safe space to share and may need to lay some ground rules about the topic, to fence off certain aspects and at times interrupt the conversation to guide it back on topic. The active facilitator role is important when introducing this kind of activity, but over time it can be come more learned and practiced by the students so require less input as the course progresses.</p>
