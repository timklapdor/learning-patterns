	<p>A quiz is a set of questions with set answers where there is clearly a wrong or right answer. They can be used to evaluate students ability to recall and interpret information or to solve specific problems. The questions themselves can be complicated and nuanced, but for effective review they need to provide sufficient feedback to the learner in order for them to identify their mistake and the correct answer moving forward. Proving feedback and answers should be considered alongside the questions themselves and developed at the same time. For example if developing multiple choice questions don't just choose random answers and one correct, choose them in order to identify common mistakes and misunderstandings - for example flipping the numerator and denominator. This will ensure that not the review process improves the students learning, rather than simply testing their knowledge.</p>
