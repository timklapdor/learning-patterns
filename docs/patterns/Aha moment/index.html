<p>Aha moment</p>
<p>An Aha moment is a planned point in the course where students unlock a key understanding or relationship in the course. While students may have these moments on their own, the aim is to construct a point in time in the course where you as the teacher create a learning sequence for the specific aim of students experiencing a breakthrough. This can be done by connecting students to a new idea in the sequence, marking a point where they level up their knowledge and expertise or discovering something new in the course.</p>
