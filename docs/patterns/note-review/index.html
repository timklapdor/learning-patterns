	<p>The aim of the Note &amp; Review is for students make their own notes in a separate location to the resource. You should direct learners to ensure that notes are able to stand alone and make sense without the original resource. The review stage requires the learner to make sense of the notes themselves, what has the learner pulled out of the resource and what can they interpret them and make sense. The review could take the form of  a summary, connection, or explanation. A way to structure this task is to separate the act of note taking and reviewing by developing shared notes and individual reviews. Another way could be by asking students to swap notes and then create a review from another student's notes. Sharing the work across the class can be useful when breadth is required and when there may be too much for a single student to look into.</p>
