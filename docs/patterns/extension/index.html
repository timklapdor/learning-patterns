	<p>An extension can be useful in directing students to other information to further their knowledge or to gain access to some remediation and supporting information. Extensions can be useful in a course where there is a required breadth of knowledge, but the depth required is up to the student. Extensions should be used at points where it would not be helpful for all students to work through more detailed information, but where certain groups of students may find it usefulâ€”the assessment question they have chosen, their previous study or experience, or their intended career choice.</p>
