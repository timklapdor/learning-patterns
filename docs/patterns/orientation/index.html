	<p>The aim of an orientation is to situate the learner and provide a state of play: where are they in the course journey, what will they learn next and how it connects to what they have learnt already and most importantly why they are going to learn the next topic. Think of the orientation as a road-sign, make it clear, short and useful for the journey ahead.</p>
