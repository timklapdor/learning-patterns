	<p>A test environment is not always available or suitable across disciplines, but at it's heart it is there to create a safe space for mistakes to be made. A test environment should really focus on allowing students to make all the mistakes possible in this safe environment and learn what the consequences of these are. This kind of learning experience would apply to developing code but also on administering doses of pharmaceuticals or  identifying problems in accounting documents or problematic data. Test environments require an understanding of the consequences of actions and decisions and provide students with a way to experience those consequences and confronting them with their mistakes. Getting something wrong is important for learning, but it can also be demoralising. It is important to enable students to uncover their mistakes, learn where they went wrong and to try again.</p>
