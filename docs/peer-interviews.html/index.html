	<p>The purpose of a Peer Interview is to talk through evolving ideas rather than comment directly on each othersâ€™ work. Students are paired up and ask each other a fixed set of questions about their work in progress to get them to summarise their work and how they approach it. It can be helpful when students are required to demonstrate additional skills, such as note-taking, bibliography, research and essay structure.</p>
