		<p class="definition">This discussion asks students to find connections and identify differences between ideas that can be found in class texts, articles, images, videos and more.</p>

	<main class="discussion">
	<p>When students understand the similarities and differences between different ideas, they are able to develop a better argument because they understand both sides. This type of question will lead to better constructed responses from students and in turn deeper, more well-rounded discussions.</p>
