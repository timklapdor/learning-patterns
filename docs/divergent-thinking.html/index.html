	<p>This activity is often thought of as 'brainstorming', generating multiple ideas and solutions by 'thinking-out-loud'. This social interaction allows students to see different perspectives and can often unlock unique and creative solutions that students may not have been able to develop independently. Affinity mapping is a common technique for this task where individuals independently write out their ideas (often on sticky notes) which are then shared with the class, who then systematically group notes that are similar or share common elements. These grouping can then be presented as a Venn diagram, flowchart, hierarchy, or some other visual or written form that captures the main ideas and their relationships.</p>
