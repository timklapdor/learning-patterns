	<p>A study plan aims to get learners to set milestones for their learning and to check their progress throughout the course. This type of review provides students with a sense of responsibility and accomplishment to personalise their learning journey throughout the course. To do this, students will have to be able to assess their current knowledge and have a clear understanding of what kind of milestones students should record. Any milestones should align the assessments and course learning outcomes with the student's goals.</p>
