	<p>The aim of a study plan is to get learners to set themselves milestones for their own study and to check their progress throughout the course. This style of review provides students with a sense of accomplishment and personalisation of their learning throughout the course. To do this, students will need to be able to assess their current knowledge and have a clear understanding of what milestones should be logged. It is important that any milestones are aligned with the assessments and course learning outcomes.</p>
