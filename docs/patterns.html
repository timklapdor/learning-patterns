	<h2>About Learning Patterns</h2>
<p>The idea of a Pattern Language comes from Christopher Alexander, an architect that was looking to empower his clients to define features and functions of a space. What he realised was that there were common &quot;patterns&quot; that can describe these features and function which can be reused to solve individual design problems.</p>
<p>The same concept can be applied to all design disciplines - graphics, web and of course learning. The idea behind a pattern language is that it makes design accessible to the client or user, that co-creation can occur through dialogue and conversation. In combination, the Learning Types and Patterns allow educators to openly engage in conversations with designers, developers, and learners to create engaging learning experiences.   <a href="https://ajet.org.au/index.php/AJET/article/view/1344/714">Peter Goodyear</a> also wrote about patterns and applying them within an educational context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Design patterns have a number of qualities which, in combination, give them the potential to be a useful way of sharing experience in the field of networked learning. A pattern is a solution to a recurrent problem in a context.</p>
<p>— Peter Goodyear (AJET, 2005)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that's where you find yourself today — a library of common patterns related to each of the Learning Types so that we could help develop and scaffold the creation of activities. Each pattern has been developed to be context, delivery and technology neutral — allowing you to apply the patterns, and sequences you create from them to be based on the learning experience. It also allows learning sequences based on patterns to be adapted to different modes of delivery and technology.</p>
<p>Feel free to use, share and utilise the patterns to aid your design.</p>
