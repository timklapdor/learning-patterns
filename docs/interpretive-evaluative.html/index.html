		<h1>interpret &amp; evaluate</h1>
		<p class="definition">A two-step discussion that first asks students to discuss the intentions of a resource and then to evaluate its effectiveness.</p>

	</header>
	<main class="discussion">
	<p>This kind of discussion starts by asking questions about the intentions or goals of the author, creator, character etc. Then students are asked to evaluate the veracity of these intentions and, finally, the effectiveness of the methods used. This kind of discussion works well with an external resource or case study to act as a stimulus. The discussion can begin with how students have interpreted and perceived the intended outcomes or purpose of the resource. After they work through that information, they can evaluate how effective and close to the resource's initial intentions.</p>
