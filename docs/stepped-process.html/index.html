	<p>A Stepped Process aims to make explicit every action the learner needs to take and what the result should be once they've performed each step. A Stepped Process is a form of instructions where the direction for each step is not just listed but also explained, how or why it is essential. For example, Ikea instructions provide clear instructions, but they don't explain why each step is required or what it contributes to the whole. A Stepped Process offers clear directions and includes reasoning, especially around any decision-making students would be expected to replicate when applying the process in different circumstances.</p>
