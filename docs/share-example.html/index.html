	<p>This activity aims for learners to share a tangible example from their worldview and experience. This can be useful to work out how well learners understand the topic. If they can draw upon their circumstances to find a relatable example, it can demonstrate their ability to apply their knowledge to different discipline areas. Courses with students from various professions, backgrounds and disciplines can benefit significantly from being exposed to unfamiliar circumstances or possibilities they would not have thought of on their own.</p>
