	<p>A quote aims to provide the learner with a direct link to a primary source. It reaffirms the statement's authenticity and benefits the learner by seeing the concept in its original form. Quotes help construct a context for students and can be invaluable in explaining how ideas and practices have evolved. They can also help provide students with concise explanations in the original author's words. Remember that quotes can be more than just published text. Video, audio and images can help provide additional information to students beyond the words themselves by showing the context of where and when they came. Utilising historical recordings can also help to dual-encode and reinforce essential information.</p>
