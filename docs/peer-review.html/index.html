	<p>Peer Review enables students to step outside their work to see how other students tackle a task. Peer Review requires instruction to guide students to review aspects of another student's work. For example, how has the other student structured their work or how have they applied a concept? They must then be able to provide relevant and meaningful feedback. There also needs to be ground rules with this activity to ensure students are constructive in their review and how they give feedback to each other. It may be helpful to provide students with some additional resources or examples about how to provide feedback.</p>
