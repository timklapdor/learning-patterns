	<p>Scenario-based learning is a compelling experience for students as it allows them to observe, or be placed into, a simulation of real life. For genuine formative learning, the debrief is the focus as it enables the observer and participant to reflect on the task and how their participation can be corrected or improved. The debrief can be used to discuss what went wrong and what went right, allowing learners to reflect on their own practice. A good debrief isn't just about observing the scenario itself but linking the thought processes, emotions and experience to the learning journey. A debrief is a facilitated process where discussion is developed and steered to meet the objective of providing students with the chance to practice and reflect on and develop their skills and experience from that practice.</p>
