	<p>Effective worked examples have highly integrated components and combine multiple modalities in their presentation. At a minimum, they provide text and visual elements that walk the student through a process. Adding video, voice, motion and graphical elements helps emphasise conceptual structures through labelling or segmenting a process. Showing how you work and thinking out loud are essential concepts to model for students to learn the process, in addition to the solution. Highlighting key decision points and choices, especially where an incorrect choice can be catastrophic, is essential to students to aid their adoption. Follow up a Worked Example with a practice activity so students can test their abilities.</p>
