	<p>A teaser aims to encourage students to continue their learning by purposely withholding information. This might be calling out that in the future there will be interesting facts, applications of knowlege or strange connections that the student will learn in the course. Used sparingly, teasers can help maintain the student's attention and can also change their perceptions about what might be considered &quot;dull&quot; topics. Creating teasers can also be a creative way to rethink how you as the teacher present content, and to communicate the topics in ways that have been hugely successful by people like Dr Karl (ABC/Triple J) and other public science communicators. It's important that by teasing students you are setting expectations - which you'll have to live up to! So don't over-promise and under-deliver.</p>
