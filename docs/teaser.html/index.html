	<p>A teaser encourages students to continue learning by purposely withholding information. A teaser calls out that in the future, there will be fascinating facts, applications of knowledge or strange connections that the student will learn in the course. Used sparingly, teasers can help maintain students' attention and change their perceptions about what might be considered &quot;dull&quot; topics. Creating teasers can also be a creative way to rethink how you as the teacher present content and to communicate the topics in ways that have been hugely successful by people like Dr Karl (ABC/Triple J) and other public science communicators. It's important to note that teasing students means setting expectations - which you'll have to live up to! So don't over-promise and under-deliver.</p>
