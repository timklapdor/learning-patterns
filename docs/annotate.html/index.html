	<p>Annotation of an external resource aims to enable critique of the resource itself or what the resource contains. The focus of this critique would depend on the context within which the task is occurring. For example, learners may be asked to critique an argument or theory discussed in the resource to demonstrate their engagement with theoretical concepts. Alternatively, learners may be asked to critique how a resource has been structured and presented to demonstrate their engagement with text and language composition.</p>
