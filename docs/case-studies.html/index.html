	<p>The aim of a case study is for learners to practically apply their skills and understanding of learned facts to a real-world situation. They are helpful for complex situations where solutions are uncertain and require multiple perspectives. They are perfect launch pads for further class discussion or as a project for individuals or small groups. Case studies allow students to practice inductive and deductive reasoning depending on the location within their course. Inductive reasoning requires the student to understand what is going on from the case study and then have it confirmed and explained in the following content. For deductive reasoning, the case study would test what they learned previously and apply the theory provided to this particular scenario.</p>
