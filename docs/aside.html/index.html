	<p>Asides help provide contextual information. They are a common feature in magazines, newspapers, and textbooks, providing readers with additional information related to what is being covered but doesn't necessarily fit with the narrative structure. Students can benefit from asides to provide information at the point of need and use them for supporting and contextual information. Asides are often used to provide summaries and lists of data, essential facts, statistics and timelines alongside the content so that students don't have to move away or navigate to another page or source of information.</p>
