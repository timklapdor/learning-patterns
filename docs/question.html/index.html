	<p>The aim of answering questions is to help the learner make sense of the resource in the context of what is being studied. You will provide the learner with the questions before engaging with the external resource so they can look for and extract the necessary information as they go. The questions provide an opportunity for you to direct the learner to engage more deeply in the resource to better understand the context of the topic being studied.</p>
