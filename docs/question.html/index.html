	<p>The aim of answering questions about an external resource is to help the learner make sense of the resource in the context of the topic being studied. The learner would know what the questions are prior to reading the external resource so that they can look for and extract the necessary information from the resource to be able to answer the questions. The questions themselves would provide an opportunity for the learner to understand the external resource in the context of the topic being studied.</p>
