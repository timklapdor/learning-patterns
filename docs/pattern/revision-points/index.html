<p>Revision points within the course can aid learners with the development of their schema and understanding within the course. If you know that there are key topics and concepts within the course that students must know, you can set up revision points within the course rather than leaving it to chance. These can then be designed to encourage specific types of revision - memorisation and recollection, practice questions, comprehension - that are specific to the desired outcomes.</p>
