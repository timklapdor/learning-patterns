<p>The aim of an instruction is to enable learners to independently perform a task or achieve a desired outcome. An instruction can be fairly basic with explicit information for every step of the process, leaving no chance for error. An instruction can also be more complex, where learners need to make decisions at certain points of the process based on information they have previously been given or it can be reasonably assumed they have already attained.</p>
