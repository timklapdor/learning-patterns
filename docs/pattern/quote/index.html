<p>The aim of a quote is to provide the learner with a direct link to a primary source. This reaffirms authenticity of the statement, but also has the benefit of seeing the concept in its original form. Quotes are useful for constructing context for students and can be invaluable in explaining how ideas and practices have evolved over time. They can also be useful in providing students with concise explanations in the words of the original author. Remember that quotes can be considered more broadly than just published text. Video, audio and images can help provide useful information to students beyond the words themselves by showing the context of where and when they come from.</p>
