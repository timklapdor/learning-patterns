<p>A summary aims to reinforce the main points of the content  to aid the development of the learner's schema. The summary provides an opportunity to provide clear descriptions of what you want students to learn, and provide them with an opportunity to recall the related information provided to them. This helps to direct the learner's effort, clarify any misunderstanding and develop recall pathways that are vital for future development and learning. Don't underestimate the power of a good summary, but make sure it's clear, specific to the content, and as succinct as possible.</p>
