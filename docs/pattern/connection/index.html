<p>The aim of a connection is to describe the relationship between two concepts, ideas or topics. Creating connections is one of the keys to students learning and aids in the development of their own schema. For many students moving along the novice/expert continuum these connections are missing, so providing them with explicity and direct information about how things relate to one another can provide a shortcut for the learner and helps them to assimilate new information. Try and be explicit and concise when you develop your connect. Be clear as to what relates, how it relates and why it relates. it is also important to be clear to students why this relationship matters. In some instances it maybe useful to illustrate this relationship and create or develop a graphic to convey how the connection works.</p>
