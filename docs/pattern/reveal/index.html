<p>A reveal helps to explain a hidden process to students, inviting them to see the inner workings and what was previously hidden from view. This can be akin to seeing how a magician does their trick, with the specific aim of dispelling the magic and showing that it is in fact application of skill and knowledge. A reveal can assist in developing the student's opinion of themselves as they move from novice to expertâ€”they are earning the right to gain access to the secrets of the discipline.</p>
