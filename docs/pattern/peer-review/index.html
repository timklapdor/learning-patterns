<p>Peer Review enables students to step outside of their own minds to see how other students are tackling a task. Peer Review requires some instruction to guide students to review certain elements of another student's work. For example, how has the other student structured the work or how have they applied a concept? They must then be able to provide relevant and meaningful feedback. There also needs to be ground rules with this type of activity to ensure students are constructive in their review and provision of feedback to each other. It may be useful to provide students with some resources about how to provide feedback.</p>
