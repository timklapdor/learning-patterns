	<p>An Aha moment is a planned point in the course where students unlock a critical understanding or relationship in the course. While students may have these moments on their own, the aim is to construct a point in time in the course where you, as the teacher, create a learning sequence with the specific objective of students experiencing a breakthrough. This can be done by connecting students to a new idea in a learning sequence, marking a point where they level up their knowledge and expertise or discovering something new in the course.</p>
