	<p>The aim of summarising an external resource is to provide students with an opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of the content of a resource. Identifying and connecting concepts discussed in a resource and using skills like paraphrasing to explain them requires students to explore a resource in depth. Summaries can be recorded as part of the student's notes or shared with the class. This activity will work well as a group or class activity or to cover several resources.</p>
