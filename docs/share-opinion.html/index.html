	<p>This activity can be as simple as a prompt for students to share and contribute their opinion. All students tend to have an opinion, so creating space for them in the course is a great way to get direct insight into their learning. It can be helpful in a before and after context to chart students' change in knowledge and understanding of a topic. It is also a simple way to relate contemporary issues to the topic. It can be helpful as a diagnostic to correct misunderstandings and misinterpretations or to fill in gaps that students may have missed. If these opinions are available to be viewed by other students, they can be a resource that allows reflection on their own opinion and see what diversity is in the class.</p>
