	<p>Peer sharing is an opportunity to expose learners to different experiences, interpretations, perspectives and opinions. The aim of sharing isn't to convince students of another opinion or to reach a consensus but to demonstrate to students that there is breadth and variation in the chosen topic or concept. This activity is best suited to points in the course when drawing on the diversity within the class is beneficial. Use questions and prompts that students can react and respond to that draws on their opinions and experiences rather than a specific answer. Choose prompts with the potential for each student to respond differently, rather than those within a narrow scope of answers.</p>
