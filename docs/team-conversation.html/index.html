	<p>Dividing the class into small groups allows more space and time for active participation in a conversation. This activity groups learners together for the specific purpose of speaking more deeply with each other about the topic. The aim is for students to share knowledge and experiences to cooperate and build their understanding of a topic. You will need to provide questions that encourage students to share their thoughts and experiences. Rather than providing specific answers, you may wish to offer prompts and follow-up questions so that learners have the tools to facilitate their own deeper team conversation.</p>
