	<p>A debate allows students to explore different perspectives and can challenge their inherent biases. A debate requires structure, and it is a good idea to set up some limitations and constraints around the debate format and where students can take the topic. Often ethical topics are seen as potential areas for debates, and while they can provide an interesting topic, they can be quite tricky to navigate for inexperienced students and can quickly become unintendedly offensive. Picking a good topic is crucial, and sometimes choosing the ridiculous or extreme ends of an issue can be most effective as they require students to think critically and creatively.</p>
