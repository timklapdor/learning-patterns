	<p>A summary aims to reinforce the main points of the content to/ aid the development of the learner's schema. The summary provides an opportunity to clearly describe what you want students to learn and allow them to recall any related information. This directs the learner's effort, can clarify any misunderstandings, and is a chance to develop recall pathways vital for future development and learning. Please do not underestimate the power of a good summary, but make sure it's clear, specific to the content, and as succinct as possible.</p>
