	<p>Revision points within the course can aid learners with their understanding and development of their schema. If you know that there are key topics and concepts within the course that students must know, you can set up revision points within the course rather than leaving it to chance. These can then be designed to encourage specific types of revision - such as memorisation and recollection, practice questions, and comprehension - specific to the desired outcome.</p>
