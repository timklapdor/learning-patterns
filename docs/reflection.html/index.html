	<p>Reflection is a learnt skill that needs to be developed over time and may be an entirely new experience for many students. Introducing reflection into a course will require scaffolding to provide students with the correct level of structure and direction to ensure they get the most out of the process. Provide students with suggested questions focusing on specific areas of their study and experience.</p>
