	<p>Students review each other's work and provide input, opinions and evaluations. Using structured feedback, like a rubric, students can learn to evaluate the quality of their peers and their work. This kind of task works well for encouraging peer interaction and social learning and provides a scalable method of review and feedback that doesn't put the onus on the teaching staff. Pushing this work onto students requires students to be provided with support, clear instructions and clarity around the method of review, what they should be looking for and tone of communication. If it is left too open, there is the potential for students to misinterpret, misunderstand and compound that with incorrect feedback on their work.</p>
