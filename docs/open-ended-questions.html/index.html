	<p>Open questions should allow every student to participate and contribute to a discussion because there is no singular, wrong or right answer. They require students to elaborate on their points and apply knowledge of concepts to new settings or to synthesise and combine them with the information they already know. Instead, an open-ended question should provide a hook to what the student already knows or allows them to connect new information to a circumstance they are familiar with. Good open-ended questions tend to be grammatically closed but cognitively open. They provide a narrow or simple framing but allow the student to open up and invite elaboration and enquiry. An initial yes/no answer to a question can be opened up by a follow-up question like &quot;Why do you think that?&quot;, &quot;Could there be an instance where that's not the case?&quot;.</p>
