	<p>An analogy aims to provide another reference point for the learner to understand a new concept. Useful analogies draw on events, experiences, or knowledge that learners are likely to relate to, providing an existing scaffold upon which to build upon. Use analogies sparingly, as too many will become cumbersome.</p>
