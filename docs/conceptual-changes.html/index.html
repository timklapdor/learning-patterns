	<p>This discussion gets students to form their opinions about a topic based on the content they’ve read or watched. Once they’ve developed their ideas, they must search for common misconceptions of the topic. This forces students to question their methods and challenge their original thoughts. These are great ways to get students thinking critically about their ideas and coach them to reflect and self-evaluate.</p>
