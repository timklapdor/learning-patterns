	<p>An Aha moment is a planned point in the course where students unlock a critical understanding or relationship in the course. While students may have these moments on their own, the aim is to construct a point in time in the course where you, as the teacher, create a learning sequence with the specific objective of students experiencing a breakthrough. This can be done by connecting students to a new idea in a learning sequence, marking a point where they level up their knowledge and expertise or discovering something new in the course.</p>

	<p>Asides help provide contextual information. They are a common feature in magazines, newspapers, and textbooks, providing readers with additional information related to what is being covered but doesn't necessarily fit with the narrative structure. Students can benefit from asides to provide information at the point of need and use them for supporting and contextual information. Asides are often used to provide summaries and lists of data, essential facts, statistics and timelines alongside the content so that students don't have to move away or navigate to another page or source of information.</p>

	<p>A connection describes the relationship between two concepts, ideas or topics. Creating connections is one of the keys to students learning and aids the development of their schema. For many students moving along the novice/expert continuum, these connections are missing, so providing them with explicit and direct information about how things relate to one another can provide a shortcut for the learner and helps them to assimilate new information. Try and be accurate and concise when you develop your connection. Be clear as to what relates, how it relates and why it relates. It is also essential to be clear to students why this relationship matters. In some instances, it may be helpful to illustrate this relationship and create or develop a graphic to convey how the connection works.</p>

	<p>The aim of a definition is to guarantee the meaning of a term is consistent for all learners. It also helps to negate other meanings or uses of the terms learners bring from other contexts or assumed knowledge.

	<p>The aim of a demonstration is to perform the activity or act out a concept so that students can watch the outcomes of an experiment, process or phenomenon. The power of demonstrations for learning is that they provide students with experiences of real events which can help raise students’ interest and motivation and can help students carry out their own practical work more effectively. A demonstration allows you to focus your students on particular aspects that they might otherwise miss, which can support your explanations and scaffold the students’ understanding.</p>

	<p>Examples are powerful ways to broaden and deepen student learning. They allow students to 'see' a concept and how it can be applied.

	<p>The aim of an explanation is to describe how something works or is done. The structure of an explanation should start with the topic that identifies what is being explained. Next should come the supporting information that gives a sequenced explanation of how and why something works or happens. If it's required, a concluding sentence should give a brief summary of the process. When it comes to making an idea easy to understand, simple trumps clever and complicated. Make your students feel smart by building their knowledge and confidence and dazzle them with clarity. Add details sparingly—come back to one or two big ideas you know they will understand. Use an explanation to help and support the student embed the concept and relate it to their understanding.</p>

	<p>An extension can be useful in directing students to other information to further their knowledge or to gain access to some remediation and supporting information. Extensions can be useful in a course where there is a required breadth of knowledge, but the depth required is up to the student. Extensions should be used at points where it would not be helpful for all students to work through more detailed information, but where certain groups of students may find it useful—the assessment question they have chosen, their previous study or experience, or their intended career choice.</p>

	<main class="content">
	<p>The adage &quot;A picture is worth a thousand words&quot; describes the ability of a single image to convey complex and sometimes multiple ideas more effectively than a descriptive text. Illustrations are able to explain complex ideas in a simple and more accessible format by encoding information through colour, shapes and rhythm rather than just relying on text and words. This often requires some creativity and understanding of the concept in order to accurately encode that information using visual devices, but this can be achieved through collaboration with designers and media experts. An illustration should aim to depict the concept, not necessarily interpret it, and can often help to reduce supporting information to a minimum. Rather than make the illustration do everything, use it with patterns like explanations. You can also use multiple illustrations to go through a stepped process, where the image evolves with extra detail as you go through each part of the explanation. Do this on a timeline, and you have an animation.</p>

	<p>The aim of an instruction is to enable learners to independently perform a task or achieve a desired outcome. An instruction can be fairly basic with explicit information for every step of the process, leaving no chance for error. An instruction can also be more complex, where learners need to make decisions at certain points of the process based on information they have previously been given or it can be reasonably assumed they have already attained.</p>

	<p>A loop back is a narrative device that helps student learning by recalling topics, ideas and information that have previously been mentioned. A loop back engages students by engaging their recall ability and helps to develop connections in their schema. The original idea can act as an anchor or foundation from which to expand and branch from. When using this pattern, provide a link back to the original idea and where it is in the course, include a brief summary of it, and then explain why you are asking the student to reconsider it.</p>

	<p>An Orientation should situate the learner and provide a state of play: where are they in the course journey; what will they learn next and how it connects to what they've learnt already; and most importantly, why they are going to learn the next topic. The orientation can be part of a broader narative of the course, but that can be challenging and simple for courses that deal with complex material. In most situations, you should think of the orientation as a road sign – so make it clear, short and valuable for the journey ahead.</p>

	<p>A quote aims to provide the learner with a direct link to a primary source. It reaffirms the statement's authenticity and benefits the learner by seeing the concept in its original form. Quotes help construct a context for students and can be invaluable in explaining how ideas and practices have evolved. They can also help provide students with concise explanations in the original author's words. Remember that quotes can be more than just published text. Video, audio and images can help provide additional information to students beyond the words themselves by showing the context of where and when they came. Utilising historical recordings can also help to dual-encode and reinforce essential information.</p>

For example, Ikea instructions provide clear instructions, but they don't explain why each step is required or what it contributes to the whole. A Stepped Process offers clear directions and includes reasoning, especially around any decision-making students would be expected to replicate when applying the process in different circumstances.</p>

	<p>A teaser encourages students to continue learning by purposely withholding information. A teaser calls out that in the future, there will be fascinating facts, applications of knowledge or strange connections that the student will learn in the course. Used sparingly, teasers can help maintain students' attention and change their perceptions about what might be considered &quot;dull&quot; topics. Creating teasers can also be a creative way to rethink how you as the teacher present content and to communicate the topics in ways that have been hugely successful by people like Dr Karl (ABC/Triple J) and other public science communicators. It's important to note that teasing students means setting expectations - which you'll have to live up to! So don't over-promise and under-deliver.</p>

Adding video, voice, motion and graphical elements helps emphasise conceptual structures through labelling or segmenting a process. Showing how you work and thinking out loud are essential concepts to model for students to learn the process, in addition to the solution. Highlighting key decision points and choices, especially where an incorrect choice can be catastrophic, is essential to students to aid their adoption.

	<p>The aim of the Note &amp; Review is for students to make notes about a resource in a separate location. Learners should ensure their notes can stand alone and make sense without the original resource. This means taking notes using their own words and in their voice. The review stage requires the learner to utilise their notes and interpret them to create a summary, connection, or explanation. An alternative way to structure the task is to separate the act of note-taking by creating a shared note and then creating individual reviews. Another way could be asking students to swap notes and then create a review from another student's notes. Sharing the work across the class can be helpful when breadth is required, and you are seeking to expose students to a variety of external resources, and there are too many for a single student.</p>

Instead of just consuming a resource, the aim is to create an activity that helps the learner contextualise the resource more broadly. Typically, learners are told to consider the topic as they work through an external resource that has been chosen specifically to relate to the current topic. The aim here, however, is to ask learners to create that relationship, which means the resource should be a little left-field. Rather than being directly related or from the established literature, the resource may be an example of theory in practice, a concept's execution, or a recent news article. Learners will have to work to relate the resource to the topic at hand. Ideally, this activity would be followed by an Interactive activity. This subsequent activity would allow learners to communicate with their instructor or peers about their understanding of the relevance of the resource to the topic.</p>

So the ability to Apply a Model to different circumstances is valuable for students to practice. An excellent way to go about this is to set up scenarios where this can occur. In these scenarios, it is essential to ensure alignment between previous examples the students have seen with this new scenario. If important values, terms or components of the model need to be identified correctly, then they should have their equivalents in the new scenario for students to match these up.

The debrief can be used to discuss what went wrong and what went right, allowing learners to reflect on their own practice. A good debrief isn't just about observing the scenario itself but linking the thought processes, emotions and experience to the learning journey.

Deploying their skills several times assists in the development of understanding and schema. Feedback at each attempt is also important as students need to be able to evaluate themselves and diagnose problem areas and mistakes.

	<p>When setting up a critique is vital that it stays contained and focused on the work. You may want to start by asking the creators to provide contextual information to the reviewers, such as their intent, who their audience was, and what constraints and choices they made. It is also worthwhile setting goals and intentions for the reviewers too - what are they expected to comment on, what is out of bounds, and what they can provide suggestions or instructions. Some of the most valuable critiques are necessarily the judgements, but questions back to the student about their work. Get reviewers to focus feedback on addressing the intent and goals of the work and how effective they were in addressing them.</p>

This kind of task works well for encouraging peer interaction and social learning and provides a scalable method of review and feedback that doesn't put the onus on the teaching staff. Pushing this work onto students requires students to be provided with support, clear instructions and clarity around the method of review, what they should be looking for and tone of communication. If it is left too open, there is the potential for students to misinterpret, misunderstand and compound that with incorrect feedback on their work.</p>

	<p>A quiz is a set of questions with set answers where there is a wrong or right answer. Students should use them to evaluate their ability to recall and interpret information or solve specific problems. The questions themselves can be complicated and nuanced. For an effective review, a quiz needs to provide feedback to the learners so they can identify their mistakes and correctly answer moving forward. Feedback and answers should be developed at the same time as the questions. For example, if creating multiple choice questions, don't just choose random answers and one correct. Choose them in a way that helps to identify common mistakes and misunderstandings - for example, flipping the numerator and denominator in an equation. It will ensure the review process improves the students learning, rather than simply testing their knowledge.</p>

	<p>A technique to help students learn is Spaced Repetition, which helps students develop skills and reinforce knowledge, helping to strengthen connections in their schema and aid recall. Space Repetition requires tasks to be spaced out and occur across the teaching period. Rather than a one-off, students learn from the routine and regular opportunity to apply knowledge and skills. Each task can use the same knowledge or skills and apply them to different situations, but they must include repeated elements. Including feedback in the task helps students improve their ability and skill and, over time, improves their performance.</p>

	<main class="review">
	<p>Feedback is vital to personal development, and each individual can benefit from it when done correctly. It is essential to understand that feedback, by its nature, is a cyclical process rather than linear. This means that feedback shouldn't be the end point of a task and instead occur before the last step so it can be actioned and implemented. One common problem with assessments is that the learner focuses on the marks rather than the journey they go through and the evolution of their work. We often consciously make feedback disposable in that sense and secondary to the marks attached because there is no follow-through. At the course design stage, it is essential to consider how formative and summative assessments can work together and how a review task like task feedback can feed into a subsequent assessment where marks are attached. Consider pairing review tasks, like task feedback, with productive assessments so that marks are given to actioning feedback and improving the work done by students.</p>

	<p>A test environment is not always available or suitable, but it creates a safe space for learners to make mistakes. A test environment should allow students to make all the possible mistakes in this safe environment and learn from the consequences. This learning experience is common in some fields, like developing code, but can be applied more broadly to other disciplines. From administering doses of pharmaceuticals to identifying problems in accounting documents to working with problematic data sets. Test environments develop an understanding of the consequences of their actions and decisions and provide a way to experience the consequences and confront them through their mistakes. Getting something wrong is necessary for learning, but it can also be demoralising. It's vital to enable students to uncover their mistakes, learn where they went wrong and try again.</p>

	<p>This kind of interaction is about trying to involve the class as a whole and is perfect for when you want to explore diversity and individual experiences within the class. It is essential to note that the conversation needs to be facilitated well for the group to feel able to contribute. A facilitator often needs to encourage and invite class members to speak for students to feel comfortable sharing. This may require the facilitator to take the lead and share their thoughts or experiences before inviting others. The facilitator needs to ensure that the class is a safe space to share and may need to lay some ground rules about the topic, fence off certain aspects and at times interrupt the conversation to guide it back on topic. The active facilitator role is essential when introducing this kind of activity, but over time, it can become more learned and practised by the students and requires less input as the course progresses.</p>

	<p>Cooperation is another form of group work, but rather than working on a single specific task together, learners share resources and efforts to complete their own tasks. This could include developing a shared reading list, assembling a glossary, contributing to a data set, or discussing key issues – which then aids each student complete their own task. This shared work reduces the load on the individual, and a single contribution can have a much more significant impact when collected from the whole class. Cooperative tasks also reduce the risks and problems usually associated with group assessments by decoupling the group's efforts from the individual's mark.</p>

	<p>This activity is often thought of as 'brainstorming', generating multiple ideas and solutions by 'thinking-out-loud'. This social interaction allows students to see different perspectives and can often unlock unique and creative solutions that students may not have been able to develop independently. Affinity mapping is a common technique for this task where individuals independently write out their ideas (often on sticky notes) which are then shared with the class, who then systematically group notes that are similar or share common elements. These grouping can then be presented as a Venn diagram, flowchart, hierarchy, or some other visual or written form that captures the main ideas and their relationships.</p>

	<p>While it is essential to provide students with structured interaction, it can also be helpful to provide opportunities in the course for free-form and unstructured sessions. Drop-in and student-led sessions can augment timetabled interactive sessions and provide an additional point for students to connect or seek support from teaching staff. These sessions should coincide with scheduled points in the course, like assessment submission dates, to help clarify details and answer questions. They may also be prompted by discussion forums or questions during scheduled teaching sessions. They can also be added to a course plan to coincide with challenging topics or known problematic areas within the course.</p>

	<p>Peer sharing is an opportunity to expose learners to different experiences, interpretations, perspectives and opinions. The aim of sharing isn't to convince students of another opinion or to reach a consensus but to demonstrate to students that there is breadth and variation in the chosen topic or concept. This activity is best suited to points in the course when drawing on the diversity within the class is beneficial. Use questions and prompts that students can react and respond to that draws on their opinions and experiences rather than a specific answer. Choose prompts with the potential for each student to respond differently, rather than those within a narrow scope of answers.</p>

If they can draw upon their circumstances to find a relatable example, it can demonstrate their ability to apply their knowledge to different discipline areas. Courses with students from various professions, backgrounds and disciplines can benefit significantly from being exposed to unfamiliar circumstances or possibilities they would not have thought of on their own.</p>

	<p>This activity can be as simple as a prompt for students to share and contribute their opinion. All students tend to have an opinion, so creating space for them in the course is a great way to get direct insight into their learning. It can be helpful in a before and after context to chart students' change in knowledge and understanding of a topic. It is also a simple way to relate contemporary issues to the topic. It can be helpful as a diagnostic to correct misunderstandings and misinterpretations or to fill in gaps that students may have missed. If these opinions are available to be viewed by other students, they can be a resource that allows reflection on their own opinion and see what diversity is in the class.</p>

	<p>This activity aims to draw on learners' personal experiences to provide examples and for other learners to see how they relate to the topic. A personal experience has a lot of resonance with individuals. It can make learning more tangible and real for many who find engaging with textbooks and imagined scenarios challenging. Experiences are, by their nature, personal and can be linked to quite intimate or emotional moments. It is important to acknowledge this might be the case in the activity instructions, as some students may not feel comfortable sharing their experiences, especially if they are negative. Respect your learners and their privacy and always invite them to share, which many will do without issue, rather than make it a mandatory requirement.</p>

	<main class="interactive">
	<p>A Team Task requires learners to work together, build consensus and create a shared body of work. Some good examples of tasks that would be suitable would include; working through a problem, example or case study; contributing to a document or shared response; or creating a list of resources, papers and literature. These kinds of tasks can work as asynchronous and synchronous tasks and are helpful for low-stakes work and getting students used to learning in a social context. These tasks must be scaffolded and provide learners with clear instructions and roles, especially when introduced to students. If these tasks are used consistently throughout a course or program, you can reduce these explicit instructions as learners become used to this way of working and self-organise. It is important to note that regardless of the level of study, you should treat each group of students as novices when it comes to this kind of task. Knowledge and experiences of teamwork apply to specific groups, and what works in one group may not transfer to another.</p>
