	<p>The aim of a demonstration is to perform the activity or act out a concept so that students can watch the outcomes of an experiment, process or phenomenon. The power of demonstrations for learning is that they provide students with experiences of real events which can help raise students’ interest and motivation and can help students carry out their own practical work more effectively. A demonstration allows you to focus your students on particular aspects that they might otherwise miss, which can support your explanations and scaffold the students’ understanding.</p>
