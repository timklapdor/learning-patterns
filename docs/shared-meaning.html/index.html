		<h1>shared meaning</h1>
		<p class="definition">Let students explore what a new term or concept means to them as individuals. This creative freedom helps them find their authentic voice but encourages discourse around how others have interpreted that concept.</p>

	</header>
	<main class="discussion">
	<p>Ask students directly “What does _______ mean to you?”. You may also want to assist students in engaging with each other. Ask them to interpret someone else's answer or to comment where it is similar or hugely different.</p>
