	<p>There are often different perspectives and ways of understanding complex situations, issues and topics. Students can benefit from developing a shared understanding and making meaning together to understand and work with complex information. This discussion can be facilitated by asking students, &quot;What does _______ mean to you?&quot;. You may also want to assist students in engaging with each other. Ask them to interpret someone else's answer or to comment where it is similar or hugely different. This creative freedom helps students find their authentic voice but encourages discourse around how others have interpreted the concept.</p>
