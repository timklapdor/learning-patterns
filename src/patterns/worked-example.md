definition: ["An instructional device that provides an expert's solution to a given problem for a learner to study."]
scaffold: ["Effective worked examples have highly integrated components and combine multiple modalities in their presentation. At a minimum, they provide text and visual components that walk the student through a process. The addition of video, voice, motion and graphical elements help to emphasise conceptual structures through labelling or segmenting of a process. Showing your working and thinking out loud are important concepts to model for students in order to learn the process in addition to the solution. Highlight key decision points and choice, especially where an incorrect choice can be catastrophic. Follow up a Worked Example with a practice activity so that students can test out their abilities.
