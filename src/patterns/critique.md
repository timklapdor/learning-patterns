scaffold: ["Setting up a critique is important to ensure that it stays contained and focussed on the work. You may want to start by asking the creators to provide contextual information to the reviewers such as what was their intent, who was their audience, what constraints and choices did they make. It is also worthwhile setting goals and intentions for the reviewers too - what are they expected to comment on, what is out of bounds, to provide suggestions nor instructions. Some of the most valuable critique may not be judgements but questions back to the student about their work. Get reviewers to focus feedback in terms of addressing the intent and goals, and how effective they are in addressing them. "]
