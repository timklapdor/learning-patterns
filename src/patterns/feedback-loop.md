definition: "Students complete a task, get feedback and then redo or modify the original document to make improvements and correct mistakes and errors."
scaffold: "A feedback loop allows learners to practice, get feedback, and then apply that feedback to modify their original submission. The loop aims to evaluate the student's ability to make the required changes more than their proficiency at the task. The loop could be part of formative or summative assessments, where the initial submission is treated as a draft and not marked, whereas the final version is, with a significant component of the marks being on how well the student has implemented the requested changes. One way to do this is for students to submit their work, giving feedback using track changes and comments. The student then actions the feedback, and the document is resubmitted. Track changes should be on so the marker can see how the work has progressed and how the student has addressed the comments and markup in the document."
