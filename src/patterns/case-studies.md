definition: ["Students work through a case study and dissect the key decision points, intended and actual outcomes, and reasons."]
scaffold: ["The aim of a case study is for learners to practically apply their skills and their understanding of learned facts, to a real-world situation. They are useful for situations that are complex and solutions are uncertain and require multiple perspectives. They are perfect launch pads for further class discussion, or as a project for individuals or small groups. Case studies provide students with opportunites to practice inductive and deductive reasoning depending on the location within the course they are used. Inductive reasoning requires the student to develop an understanding of what is going on from the case study and then having it confirmed and explained in the content following. For deductive reasoning the case study would test what they have learnt previously and apply the theory provided to this particular scenario.  "]
