activity: "discussion"
tags: "discussion"
type: "discursive"
pattern: "assess, diagnose, act"
status: "live"
definition: "A discussion framed around three key actions that students undertake. Assess what the issue or problem at hand. Diagnose what the root cause of the issue or problem. Actions that can be taken to solve the problem."
scaffold: "This is a guided approach to problem-solving. Each step will have the student evaluate the problem and receive prompts to think of ways to address with the situation. This kind of discussion may need to happen in phases and be broken up throughout a module. First students work through the information to make an assessment. They then work through diagnostic information before being asked to develop a solution. As a group activity, there may be many variations or opinions that need to be corrected. If this occurs, you may need to steer students by providing them with an explanation."
