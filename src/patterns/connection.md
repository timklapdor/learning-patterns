definition: ["A demonstration of the relationship or association of key concepts."]
scaffold: ["A connection describes the relationship between two concepts, ideas or topics. Creating connections is one of the keys to students learning and aids the development of their schema. For many students moving along the novice/expert continuum, these connections are missing, so providing them with explicit and direct information about how things relate to one another can provide a shortcut for the learner and helps them to assimilate new information. Try and be accurate and concise when you develop your connection. Be clear as to what relates, how it relates and why it relates. It is also essential to be clear to students why this relationship matters. In some instances, it may be helpful to illustrate this relationship and create or develop a graphic to convey how the connection works."]
