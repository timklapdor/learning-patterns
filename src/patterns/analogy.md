The aim of an analogy is to provide another point of reference for the learner to understand a new concept. Useful analogies are ones that draw on events, experiences or knowledge that learners are likely to relate to, providing an existing scaffold from which to build upon. Use analogies sparingly as too many will become cumbersome.
