definition: "Provide students with a task that is repeated a number of times and utilises feedback to improve their process."
scaffold: "A technique to help students learn is Spaced Repetition, which helps students develop skills and reinforce knowledge, helping to strengthen connections in their schema and aid recall. Space Repetition requires tasks to be spaced out and occur across the teaching period. Rather than a one-off, students learn from the routine and regular opportunity to apply knowledge and skills. Each task can use the same knowledge or skills and apply them to different situations, but they must include repeated elements. Including feedback in the task helps students improve their ability and skill and, over time, improves their performance."
