activity: ["interactive"]
type: ["social"]
pattern: ["share opinion"]
scaffold: ["This activity can be a simple prompt for students to share and contribute their opinion. This can be useful in a before and after context, to chart their knowledge and understanding before a topic, but may also be useful in the context of contemporary issues that relate to the topic being covered. These activities can be quickly updated each time a course is run, or just more frequency than the typical course review cycle. They can be a simple way to add contemporary and contextual content into a course and engage with students understanding. This can be useful to do before a lesson or tutorial as a diagnostic to correct misunderstandings, misinterpretations or to fill in gaps that students may have missed. If these are available to view by other students, they can use them as a resource to reflect on their own opinion and see what diversity is in the class."]
