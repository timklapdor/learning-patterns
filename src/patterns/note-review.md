activity: "external"
tags: "external"
type: "investigative"
pattern: "note & review"
status: ""
definition: "Students actively take notes and then review them to create a summary of the resource."
scaffold: "The aim of the Note & Review is for students to make notes about a resource in a separate location. Learners should ensure their notes can stand alone and make sense without the original resource. This means taking notes using their own words and in their voice. The review stage requires the learner to utilise their notes and interpret them to create a summary, connection, or explanation. An alternative way to structure the task is to separate the act of note-taking by creating a shared note and then creating individual reviews. Another way could be asking students to swap notes and then create a review from another student's notes. Sharing the work across the class can be helpful when breadth is required, and you are seeking to expose students to a variety of external resources, and there are too many for a single student."
