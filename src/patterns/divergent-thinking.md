tags: ["interactive"]
type: ["social"]
pattern: ["divergent thinking"]
status: [""]
definition: ["Students work collaboratively to address a problem and generate multiple ideas and expand the range of possible solutions."]
scaffold: ["This kind of activity is often thought of as 'brainstorming' and requires the generation of multiple ideas and solutions by 'thinking out loud'. This social interaction allows students to see different perspectives and can often unlock unique and creative solutions that students may not have been able to develop on their own. Affinity mapping is a common technique for this kind of task where individuals independently write out their ideas (often on sticky notes) which are then shared with the class, who then systematically group notes that are similar or share common elements. These grouping can then be presented as a Venn diagram, flowchart, hierarchy, or some other visual or written form that captures the main ideas and their relationships."]
