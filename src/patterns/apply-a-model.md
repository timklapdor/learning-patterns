definition: "Use an existing model and apply it to a new circumstance."
scaffold: "A good deal of learning comes from applying knowledge to other areas. This isn't necessarily an intuitive process and often requires adaption to work. So the ability to Apply a Model to different circumstances is valuable for students to practice. An excellent way to go about this is to set up scenarios where this can occur. In these scenarios, it is essential to ensure alignment between previous examples the students have seen with this new scenario. If important values, terms or components of the model need to be identified correctly, then they should have their equivalents in the new scenario for students to match these up. Remember that any information asymmetry between examples and the scenario will make it far more difficult for the student to connect the model to the new
situation."
