activity: ["interactive"]
type: ["social"]
pattern: ["just in time support"]
status: [""]
definition: ["Provide opportunities for staff and student to interact and provide just-in-time support. These sessions create an opportunity for less structured learning and discussion that is more personalised to the student's needs."]
scaffold: ["While it is important to provide students with structured interaction, it can also be useful to provide opportunities in the course for free-form and unstructured sessions to take place. Drop in sessions and student-led sessions can augment timetabled tutorials and provide an additional point for students to touch base or seek out support from teaching staff. These sessions should coincide with scheduled points in the course, like assessment submission dates, to help clarify details and answer questions. They may also be prompted from discussion forums or questions during scheduled teaching sessions but can be added into a courses plan to coincide with difficult topics or known problematic areas within the course."]
