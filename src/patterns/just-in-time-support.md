definition: ["Provide opportunities for staff and students to interact and provide less structured learning and discussion to facilitate just-in-time support."]
scaffold: ["While it is essential to provide students with structured interaction, it can also be helpful to provide opportunities in the course for free-form and unstructured sessions. Drop-in and student-led sessions can augment timetabled interactive sessions and provide an additional point for students to connect or seek support from teaching staff. These sessions should coincide with scheduled points in the course, like assessment submission dates, to help clarify details and answer questions. They may also be prompted by discussion forums or questions during scheduled teaching sessions. They can also be added to a course plan to coincide with challenging topics or known problematic areas within the course."]
