activity: "practice"
tags: "practice"
type: "formative"
pattern: "completion example"
status: "live"
definition: "Work through a stepped task that has missing elements."
scaffold: "This kind of practice builds student confidence and skills in addressing a process. Provide students with scaffolding by creating steps that requires them to interact with. By working through the process, students should be able to self-correct in a way that the next steps would provide feedback or information to let the student know they have made a mistake. For example, if they solve a mathematical equation and put that into another formula, they should be able to tell (or be provided with direct feedback) that the value they have entered is incorrect. In situations where learners' contribution may specifically be to demonstrate something is inaccurate or wrong, you must ensure students know that that is a possibility."
