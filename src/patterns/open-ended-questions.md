activity: ["discussion"]
type: ["inquiry"]
pattern: ["open ended questions"]
status: [""]
definition: ["Open-ended questions are questions that cannot be answered with a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’, or from a specific set of answers. They instead require the student to elaborate on their points and require them to apply knowledge and concepts to new settings or sythesise and combine with information they already know."]
scaffold: ["Open questions should allow every student to participate and contribute to a discussion because there is no singular, wrong or right answer. Instead an open ended question should provide a hook to what the student already knows, or allows them to connect new information to a circumstance they are familiar with. Good open ended questions tend to be grammatically closed but cognitively open, meaning they provide a narrow or simple framing but allow the student to open up and invite elaboration and enquiry. An initial yes/no answer to a question can be 'opened up' by the a follow up question like 'why do you think that?,' 'Could there be an instance where that's not the case?'. "]
