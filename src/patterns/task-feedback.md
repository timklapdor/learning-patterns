activity: ["review"]
type: ["evaluative"]
pattern: ["task Feedback"]
status: [""]
definition: ["Provide students with directly implementable feedback on a task. The aim is to directly address the feedback and improve their work. "]
scaffold: ["Feedback is vital to personal development and each individual can benefit from it when done correctly. It is important to understand that feedback by it's nature is a cyclical process rather than linear. What this means is that feedback shouldn't be the end point of a task, but rather it should occur before the last step in order for it to be actioned and implemented. One of the problems with many assessments is that the marks become the focus for the learner, rather than the journey they go through and the evolution of their work. We often consciously make feedback disposable in that sense and secondary to the marks attached because there is no follow through. At the course design stage, it is important to consider how formative and summative assessments can work together and how a review task like task feedback can feed into a subsequent assessment where marks are attached. Consider pairing review tasks like task feedback with productive assessments so that marks can be allocated to actioning feedback and improving the work done by students. "]
