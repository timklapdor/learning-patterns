activity: "interactive"
tags: "interactive"
type: "social"
pattern: "shared experience"
status: ""
definition: "Students share how a concept has been applied or demonstrated from their own personal and professional experience."
scaffold: "This activity aims to draw on learners' personal experiences to provide examples and for other learners to see how they relate to the topic. A personal experience has a lot of resonance with individuals. It can make learning more tangible and real for many who find engaging with textbooks and imagined scenarios challenging. Experiences are, by their nature, personal and can be linked to quite intimate or emotional moments. It is important to acknowledge this might be the case in the activity instructions, as some students may not feel comfortable sharing their experiences, especially if they are negative. Respect your learners and their privacy and always invite them to share, which many will do without issue, rather than make it a mandatory requirement.
