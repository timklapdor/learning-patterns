definition: ["Provide students with a set of questions they can answer and be provided with feedback if incorrect and guided on how to remedy their mistakes."]
scaffold: ["A quiz is a set of questions with set answers where there is a wrong or right answer. Students should use them to evaluate their ability to recall and interpret information or solve specific problems. The questions themselves can be complicated and nuanced. For an effective review, a quiz needs to provide feedback to the learners so they can identify their mistakes and correctly answer moving forward. Feedback and answers should be developed at the same time as the questions. For example, if creating multiple choice questions, don't just choose random answers and one correct. Choose them in a way that helps to identify common mistakes and misunderstandings - for example, flipping the numerator and denominator in an equation. It will ensure the review process improves the students learning, rather than simply testing their knowledge. "]
