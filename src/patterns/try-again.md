activity: ["practice"]
type: ["formative"]
pattern: ["try again"]
status: [""]
definition: ["Students repeat a task multiple times in order to test their skills, take on feedback and demonstrate understanding and improvement. "]
scaffold: ["Quite often practice tasks are finite – submitted and then assessed — and students are either marked wrong or right. In a try again model, the student continues to submit until they are correct. The aim is to ensure their competency and understanding before moving on. This ensures a solid foundation for their schema of knowledge and skills to grow. This step is especially important in foundation topics, where an understanding is a requirement for progression. Adopting this technique can drastically improve learner's success but it must be accompanied by generous and patient feedback. This feedback can take many forms and come from both teacher and peers, but the feedback needs to ensure that students are working towards a singular correct version and that they are consistent with that version.
