activity: "practice"
tags: "practice"
type: "formative"
pattern: "try again"
status: ""
definition: "Students repeat a task multiple times to test their skills, take on feedback, and demonstrate understanding and improvement."
scaffold: "Often, practice tasks are finite – submitted and then assessed — and students are either marked wrong or right. In a Try Again situation, the student continues to submit until they are 100% correct. This practice tests their competency and understanding before moving on and helps build a solid foundation and connection for their knowledge and skills to grow. This step is crucial in foundation topics, where an understanding is a requirement for progression. Adopting this technique can drastically improve a learner's success, but you must accompany it with generous and patient feedback. It can take many forms and come from teachers and peers, but it needs to ensure that students are working towards a singular correct version and that they are consistent with that version."
