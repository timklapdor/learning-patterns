definition: ["Students complete a task to develop or demonstrate a specific skill important in the discipline and their career."]
scaffold: ["The learning journey isn’t only about knowledge: often, it requires the acquisition and development of specific skills. If these skills align with the course learning outcomes or program learning outcomes, students must be provided with opportunities to practice. Development of skills requires two things: repetition and feedback. Repetition requires students to be provided with multiple chances to complete similar tasks. Deploying their skills several times assists in the development of understanding and schema. Feedback at each attempt is also important as students need to be able to evaluate themselves and diagnose problem areas and mistakes. Combining repetition and feedback means learners should have evidence of their improvement over time as they get more fluent and experienced."]
