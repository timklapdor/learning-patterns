definition: "A set up where a hidden process is revealed to the student."
scaffold: "A reveal helps to explain a hidden process to students. It invites them to see the inner workings and what has been previously hidden from view. This can be akin to seeing how a magician does their trick, with the specific aim of dispelling the magic and showing that it is, in fact, an application of skill and knowledge. A reveal can assist in developing the student's opinion of themselves as they move from novice to expert — they are earning the right to access the secrets of the discipline."
