The aim of sharing isn't to convince students of another opinion or to reach a consensus, but to demonstrate to students that there is breadth and variation in the chosen topic or concept. This kind of activity is best suited to points in the course where drawing on the diversity within the class is beneficial. Use questions and prompts for students that students can react and respond to that draws on the opinion and experience, rather than a specific answer. Chose prompts that have the potential for each student to respond differently, rather than those with a narrow scope of answers."]
