activity: ["practice"]
type: ["formative"]
pattern: ["scenario and debrief"]
scaffold: ["scenarios are incredibly powerful experiences for students as they allow the student to observe or be put into a simulation of real life. For genuine formative learning though, the debrief is the more important part as it enables the observer and participant to reflect on the task and ways that their participation can be corrected or improved. The debrief can be used to discuss what went wrong as well as what went right, and allows for learners to reflect on their own practice. A good debrief isn't just about observation of the scenario itself, but about linking the thought processes, emotions and the experience to the learning journey. A debrief needs to be a facilitated process where discussion is developed and steered to meet the objective of providing students with the chance to practice and to reflect and develop their skills and experience from that practice.
