definition: ["Students perform together (co-operate) while working on selfish yet common goals e.g. shared notes, assembly of resources/examples, perform process but submit their own analysis."]
scaffold: ["Cooperation is another form of group work, but rather than working on a single specific task together, learners instead share resources and effort in order to complete their own task. This could include developing a shared reading list, assembling a glossary, contributing to a data set, or discussing key issues – which then aids each individual student complete their own personal task. This shared work reduces the load on the individual and a single contribution can have a much larger impact when collected from the whole class.
