definition: ["Students perform together (co-operate) while working on selfish yet common goals e.g. shared notes, assembly of resources/examples, perform process but submit their own analysis."]
scaffold: ["Cooperation is another form of group work, but rather than working on a single specific task together, learners share resources and efforts to complete their own tasks. This could include developing a shared reading list, assembling a glossary, contributing to a data set, or discussing key issues – which then aids each student complete their own task. This shared work reduces the load on the individual, and a single contribution can have a much more significant impact when collected from the whole class. Cooperative tasks also reduce the risks and problems usually associated with group assessments by decoupling the group's efforts from the individual's mark."]
