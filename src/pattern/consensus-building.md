activity: ["discussion"]
type: ["inquiry"]
pattern: ["consensus building"]
scaffold: ["This kind of discussion is tricky and requires students to understand a process for reaching consensus. You should outline this for students as there are distinct phases:
1. Introduce and Clarify - students seek to understand the problem at hand and ask questions around the definitions and parameters of the problem.
2. Explore Ideas - open the discussion as an exploration to seek common and shared understanding.
3. Form a Proposal - as a group work towards a position and statement from the group. This doesn't have to be perfect, but a start.
4. Test the Proposal - test the position out and see how it performs for the group. Does it address the problem?
5. Amend the Proposal - iterate between testing and amending the statement until there is no more agreed movement.
6. Submit the Proposal - circulate the final statement from the group. "]
