activity: ["practice"]
type: ["formative"]
pattern: ["piecework tasks"]
scaffold: ["The aim of piecework tasks is to break down a more complicated or multistage process into its constituent parts in order for the learner to complete each task and receive feedback on it before moving on to the next task. This is to ensure that learners are correct and demonstrate their competency at each stage so as not to fail the larger task. This strategy should be used when a mistake at a single point will mean failure overall. Identifying these failure points is crucial to set up these tasks and each one needs to be accompanied by feedback that allows the learner to self-correct. Feedback must ensure that the learner can understand at which point they failed and the reasons why. This kind of task may require students to submit multiple times or to remedy their process before the next task through discussion with the teacher. "]
